# bagpyper
Jazz up boring .wav files with bagpipe drones

Have you ever thought, "This song would be better with bagpipes?" Of course you have! And now, you can make that happen.

*Information*

bagpyperAdd.py uses a recording of a bagpipe drone, adds it to the (mono, 44100 Hz fs) input file, and saves an output file

bagpyperSim.py simulates the bagpipe drone with a sum of sines and saves an output file


dronemono.wav is the recorded drone file

piano.wav is the test input file


bagpyperAdd.wav and bagpyperSim.wav are the added and simulated output files (using the test input file piano.wav)
